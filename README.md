# MIPS-pipelined
This is a MIPS architecture implemented using 5 stages of pipeline. The simulator is capable of
loading a specified MIPS text file (eg. sample.txt) and generate the cycle-by-cycle simulation of the MIPS
code. It should also produce/print the contents of registers, queues, and memory data for each cycle.
